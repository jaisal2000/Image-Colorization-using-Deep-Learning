# Image Colorization using Deep Learning (GANs)

## Overview
This project aims to automatically colorize grayscale images using Deep Learning techniques, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Image colorization is a fascinating problem in computer vision, and with the advancements in deep learning, it has become possible to automate this process effectively.
